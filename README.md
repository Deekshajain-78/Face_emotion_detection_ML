# Face_emotion_detection_ML
This project aims to develop a system that can automatically detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions using machine learning techniques. The system captures facial images and analyzes key features to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutrality.
